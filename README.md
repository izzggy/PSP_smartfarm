# PSP_smartfarm

Hello. 

Welcome to POSTECH Smart Farm.

My name is Boqi Chen. This project is my work for the 2019 PSP (POSTECH International Undergraduate Research Program). I was supervised by Assistant Professor Juhong Park at the Design Intelligence Lab, Dept. of Creative IT Engineering. I was working on one of Prof. Juhong Park's projects - Smart Farm. Our goal is to develop a fully automatic urban farm based on computer vision, robotics, etc. 

My work was a subproject of the Smart Farm. I helped to build a farm-pot detection system and dehydrated plant detection system which can be used to localize the potted plant and detect the dehydrated plants. 

Here are some links you may find useful to know more about our project.
